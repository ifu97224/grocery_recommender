# Grocery recommender system

#### About this project

This project builds a recommender system for a grocery store.  It utilizes data on customer behavior over a 52 week period in order to predict items a customer is likely to purchase in the following week (illustrated below):

A recommender engine such as this could be utilized to:

1.	Create a personalized digital flyer highlighting to each customer the items on sale that week that are most relevant for them
2.	Generating automated weekly shopping lists
3.	Reminding customers shopping on-line of items they may have forgotten to purchase i.e. items with high predicted relevancy for that week they did not purchase
